Today: Git basics (eventually internals "plumbing), backups & restores, 

# Git

### What does git do? 
1. Keeps track of the (recorded) history of your project, doesn't have to be complete -- depends on you! Only subset. 
2. (less appreciated by newcomers) Keeps track of your project's future... (ta-da-dahm). Keeps track of your plan for the future of your project. 

1 tends to be larger than 2, but the importance is (at the very least) equal.

### Standard Actions 
- *create a commit* -- make a change to the history. moves part of your future into the history (deeeeppp). 
- *merge* (fancier change) move a bit of future into the past, gluing together pieces of the past (okay, this analogy is poetic but is going to far.)

## Getting started + unorginized commands cuase I got so tired
1. `git init` create a new empty git repository. Don't use a lot, because you do this when you started a completely new project (it's more often to work on project at work).
1. (.5) Examine the status of the src code. `git log` 
    
    1. meta inforr. about 
    2. **a ton of options**, example `--pretty=fuller 
    3. has commiter and author diffrence, to commit is to actually add to the repo. commiter is the reviewer. Allows you to backtrace problems, responsibility and change tracker. Not all CS stuff, but buisness and social engineering, keep track of human motivation. 
        
        - `git log A..b` log everything between commit A to B. Can just type a prefix of A and B (as long as unabmbigous). This is important property of git, mention only first 5 or 6 digits, because it knows u don't need the whole shabang.
        - `HEAD` -- most recent commit 
        - v3.8 (tag name, branch name)
        - `c^` the parent of commit `c`. Recursive `c^^^` also works
        - `c^3` repeat `^`*3 back. 
        - `git diff c^^` == `git diff c c^^`, also works for git log. 
        - `git show nameOfCommitOrId`
        - `git show nameOfCommitOrId: FILE`
        - `git blame file` -- list of lines in file and showing who put that line into that file, and when -- find who is to blame. To find out "why was this line put in, grab commit id and ask for a log using git log""
        - `git blame COMMIT -- FILE` (exploring a cave, see why the code is the way it is).

2. `git clone` copies an existing repository example

        `git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git`

    When we clone we have a `.git` folder, which contains the entire history of the project. The rest is the src code. 

    1. look at src code
    2. change the src code!

3. `git diff` -- look at what you changed. Usally done at IDE level. Look at the status of the dev tree. 
4. `git status` for above 
5. `git ls-files` which files does the repository control (current). can be used as part of `grep Error $(git ls-files)` to put is as part of a commands and lookg for all error for example in all src control files. *Really fast!* 
- `grep git ls-files` is so common that git has `git grep REGX_PATTERN`                          
6. `git add` 

### Aside: to build from git
    diffutils: 
        ./bootsrap (breings in other modules needed from gnulib and whatever,)
    bootstrap adds things to .gitignore so that we don't add them
    
### Aside: .gitignore
Set of patterns telling git which files should be ignored. For example: 
    
    *.o -- ignore .o files.
    a.out 
    /node-modules

simillar to shell pattern matching, but not exactly. For example 
- `*` globbing pattern, shell style 
- if start with `/`, anchor to the current working directory. 
- *.o matches all something.o in any folder strting at the current working directory
- `!abc.o` don't ignore this, priority to whatever is first. 
- everything relative to where the .gitignore file is at. 

Some of our software components should not be in the git repository. That is, because they are 
- secret, 
- utilities that we are not changeing, 
- compilations of the src. 
- Should not put machine dependent things on repository  

The idea is to only have src you are working on, and be minimalistic. For example, `.o` should not be included. 
Resaons not to src: 
- you can regen (if really expensive to generate, but size is not huge, ussuly still put on repo though). 
- machine dependent


### Aside: Little language to identify commits
Each commit has a unique hex ID -- that's a valid and unique name for a commit. It computs a checksum of the commit to comeup with the number, computed by SHA-1. 


#### Aside: Aside SHA-1 (secure hashes) 
from data, yields fixed sized integer, where output seems random from input, small changes in data are very very different. 

## Fixing Mistakes
OMG! Just commited and found a mistake ðŸ˜«. What's now? 

More typical: editted files but haven done commit, `git reset` restes those changes. Change before it becomes history. rarely "just throw away though" 

### How to commit
1. Edit your file -- changing working files, git doesn;t know or care about them, you don't like? always refert with `git checkout -f` throws away what is now, esser version of reset.
2. `git add FILE1 FILE2` files you want to commit in the following commits. Puts the contents of these files in your future (*staging area*), can keep editing.
3. `git commit` put into the repo as fresh commit, You will be prompted for commit message. 

Suggested format for commit message: Single line summery of the change, 50 chars is nice. next line empty. Further explanation motivation. In large projects, commits are marketing tools meant to convince other users to pick up the change.  


## Aside: git is configured
We saw one config, gitignore, but its not the most important configuration. .git/hooks and othe

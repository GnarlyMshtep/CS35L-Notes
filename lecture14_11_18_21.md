Today: Git (a bit more) Internals: (comprehenssion), objects usage


# Compression 
Coding can be relative to a task

### Information theory (prespective)
How do we not violate information theory? We are not gurenteed to reduce the size, but most of the time for normal stuff generates fewer bit (otherwise you can compress again and again, etc)

## Technique1: gzip & zlib technique 
there was a patented technique that gzip was created to provide an alternative for. Subtechniques are: 

## Huffman coding
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding (in 180 textbook -- i've read!)

You want to compress. Input is divided into symbols from a finite alphabet $\Sigma{}$. Represent textual input in more precise way. (the whole unique prefix shananigan). AAAAAAAUGH $\rightarrow{}$ 0000000010010111011. (no bytes here). **know how to huffman encode by hand small $\Sigma{}$ !**. 

get $c_1,...c_n$ with probabilities $f_1,...,f_n$. Come up with a good set of bit strings. Huffman proved the optimal strategy to come up with the best possible way using a binary trr which resents the encoding, where we want the avergae to traversal to have minimum depth of search

how to: 
1. take the least used chars and put them athe bottm. combine them into a subtree. 
2. Repeat step (1) until you have 1 tree. 

That's assuming that we know the frequency table -- what if we don't? \

*static frequency table S*  sender and recipeint communicate and ecode and decode with the table. How do you agree on the table? Can sen dit first in the message -- for example. (downside -- two passes over the input (first to find frequencies and then generate again)). We don't liek that! ALthough we theoreticians don't care abotu 100 or 1000 passes its still O(n)). 

Dynamic frequency table D. Sender initially assuming all are equally likely. After the first symbol -- it's the most likely and we have a modified frequency table. We send all the frequency table (or their deltas) The recipients gets the whole encoded data and keeps track of what all the frequency tables and must know the next table element. The data becomes better encoded over time. So on asymptotic order -- we chillin'. 

Not the D's are sent, but the first is just that the recipient can reconstruct.


### Are we done? This is optimal right? :Dictionary coding
We will spend more CPU but make more space up. 

The idea: *Glue symbols together before encoding*
    input: Now is the best time for a pop quiz. 

(assign an output symbol for each word) -- huffman encode those! 
(if the sender and dictionary send a dict of words such that $\{the:\; 0001,...\}$). Encoding of words to our input symbols. For punctuation or something we may have to escape and drop to ascii and back up. 

Could have static dictionary, but what works for english may not work for java, so both sender and recipient start with empty dicts and here's how it goes. Don't ship dictionaries, just ship ... *didn;t catch that*. Questions: 

1. what's the length limit on the words? 
2. Dictionaries may get really large -- exhust RAM or become inefficient. 

As such, gzip and others don't build a dict for all the inputs and instead use a *sliding window scheme*. 

start      | window |<-here          end
------------------------------------

The window determines the dict! taht is, given a word w, if it could be found, we give it's index in the window. Now we have a bound on the size of a window and the size of a w. w size = 64k (or whatever). 

gzip uses dictionary coding to generate symbols and frequencies which it huffman codes, all dynamically (zlib does about the same thing). 

Property: *a single bit is flipped -- you're toast -- recipient will begin generating wrong dicts and your done for it*


# Git internals 
Git plumbing vs porcelin (low vs high level). We want to build high level ontop of low-level

.git wants to hide and be unobstrusive to our project. 

### .git/branches/
A file for each repository. Software archiology of git. this is only for backwards compatibillity they see that it doesn't work as well 
COMMITEDITMSG (when working on message but power out)

### .git/config/
config -- repository-specific-configuration 
[category]
    key = value 

Easy to mess up 

### .git/decription
for gitWeb. SOme peopple like to give name sto everything

### .git/HEAD
Wehn your working, you want to be working relative to somewhere in your repository. Not current timewise -- but the one that you "compare what you got to what's in there." 

### .git/gitk.chache
caches git info in a gitk friendly format. 

### .git/hooks/
Directory containing executable files that are samples git places there. *git pull also uses the lazy copying*. Hooks such as adjusting whatever git message we allow and file content and stuff. 

### .git/index
A binary file which represnets your staging area. (all the changes that you plan to make in your next version)


### info/exclude
patterns of filenames that you want git to pay no attention to. (why and additional one to .gitignore). Because this one is not shared by other people, it's not part of the history -- only for you

### .git/logs
HEAD -- log of when and how head was created and moved about. records, for each branch, the last time it got updated. Really? in logs? *check this or something*

    #### ./objects 
    The big gurrila of git. A bunch of subdirectories with /digdig to give it better searchabillity and smaller size for the repo on itself.  Each one of those is the commit, packed

    #### packed-refs
    an optimization of refs -- the tips of all the branches and tags. 

## What's in these objects? 
We have been seeing POSIX filesystem so far. tree of files and directories. Make a tree for each edit is one design that is bad. Wer'e building a different kinda filesystem ontop of posiz that is optimized for version control. The git objects system is implemented atop POSIX but not in a direct 1:1 (a single src does not go into a single object file). Still - we reuse/adapt many ideas. 

Types of objects: blobs(reg file) tree(dir) commits(symlink). Tree maps names to objects. Premission over here as well. Difference: You can change file contents, but in git you cannot change file contents -- they are all immutable -- you are tryna record history -- it shouldn't be allowed to change. (a lot of optimisations accesible) 

## Aside: building from git
Building from minimal source, where minimal satisfies maintence. minimal simplifies maintence but slows down development? I am not following. Autogen.sh (bootstrap a process).

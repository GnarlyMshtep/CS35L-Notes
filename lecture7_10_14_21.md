Today: Python basics, modulrization, deployement

### Why even look at Python? + Compatibillity 
Saves you time, see heavyweight scripting language, big community that gives a lot of libraries. Python Bandwagon -- don;t assume it'll be great forever. 

- Python 1 1994 (ancient)
- Python 2 2000 (no longer supported)
- Python 3 2008 
- Python 4 (never?)

A major issue is *compatibility* 

### Compatibality 
What features can I assume from the underlying software, and if it changes, what can I assume about it? 

### Why Python came out in the first place? 
Started with BASIC (1961) which came out as a reaction to FORTRAN (1956) a way-too-stiff language that was hard to learn and teach. BASIC was supposed to be better, more learnable. 

Students who learned BASIC came to CWI and it was bad for their teaching. They built ABC, a reaction to BASIC. Inventions of ABC: 
- Hash tables built in (not everyone needs to learn, just build it in!)
- The language enforces indentation (Indentation teaching was waste of time, easier to grade indented language)

The ABC project failed, but spawned Python â€”Let's do ABC but for professional developmers (with insights from ABC). Lessons: 
- Easy to ready, teach, write. 


## Python Object Model (Internals) 
Everything in python has a type, a single type, *an object.* Lot's of other languages, there are things which are not objects, they don't have adresses. For example, in C++ `0` has no adress, just a value. 

Every python object has a/an: 
- identity (like an adress -- I think value in the hash table) -- immutable
- type -- immutable
- value -- mutable or immutable
- attributes, extra values associated
- methods, functions that work on the object 

Distinction of *mutability* is a big deal for any OOP scripting language (design decision). 

### Equality 
```python 
a is b      #compare the identity, aka, pointer value (faster)
a == b      #compare the values of two objects
```

### Assigment 
assigment in python is more like pointer assigment. Likely. Python internals are icky.  

Integers are immutable, lists are mutable, which means set list `m=l` change, `l`, `m` changes as well. Strings are immutable, and by immutable we mean that when we chnage we are actually not changing the object, but creating a new object. 

### Variables
variables are just pointers (labels) to objects, nto the objects themself. we can change what they point to (as to something of a completly different type, but we haven't mutated the object, just changed the assigment of the variable).

### Classes
```python 
class c(a,b): #a and b are classes c inherits from 
    def __init__(): 

    def m(self, x): 
        #...
        pass

def main(): 
o = c()
o.n(27) #traverses the parent tree to find n, a method not defined by class c. Does a preorder traversal. (First found wins, the rest gets ignored).


```

## Classic Python types
A non-exhustive list: 
- Numbers
    - int 
    - float
    - complex 
    - bool
- Sequences
    - str
    - list 
    - tuple --prefered, faster and not mutable
- Mapping
    - dict
- Callables
    - functions
    - methods
    - classes

### Zooming-in; Sequences
Assume `s` is a sequence. Here are some operations: 
- `s[i]` index into s, reg for `0` $\leq{}$ `i` $\leq{}$ `len(s)`. for othe rway `s[-1]` indexes from the end (end-whaterv)
- `len(s)`
- `s[i:j:inc]` start at i, end at j (non-inclusively), at skips of `inc`. can leave out, `i`, `j` or `inc` with reasonable defults.
- `min(s)` 
- `max(s)`
- `list(s)` returns a list with the same element,if `s` is some other sequence, will convert to list. Can do same with tuple, whatever. 

`s[i:j] = a` a is a sequence. Set those indexes to a single index a.

Can contain different types. 

#### Further Zoom; Lists

`list.append(a)` add list or single elements tot the end. when appending a list we append it's elements, not the list. -- fast by allocating extra space, waiting for the next append. Allocates a whole list and moves everything when you append of the end. occusionally $\mathbb{O}(n)$.  

```python
#some common operations: 
s.count(v)
s.extend(a) #--push, 
s.insert(i, v)
s.index()
s.pop(i)
s.pop()
s.sort()
s.reverse()
```

### Zoom-In; Dictionaries
```python
d[k] = *whatever* #where k is any immutable object can be used to index in. Immutable because. Err if d[k] does not exist when invoked
d.keys()
d.values()
d.has_key()
d.get(k, defeult) #if value is absent, you can specify what is retrieved. 
len(d)
d.clear()
d.popitem() #grabs a (some) key value pair and removes it. 
d.update(d1) #updates d with dict d1, d1 wins on conflict. 
del d[k]
```
Has a domain and a range (partial function). Domain is the set of all keys you have assigned through. *aAgain, distinction between having the empty value or being unassigned.*

*implemented:* Using a hash table, where every `k` is hashed to some object. My thought is "just take the value!" but the problem is that we need the object to maintain a ref but with immutables it will remain yah. 

### Callables
```python 
f = lambda x: x+1 #a lambda expression is a nameless immutables. Useful when you don;t wanna give it a name, useful when you wanna pass in a simple function, for example 
def f(x):
    return x+1

#======================================
def f(x, *args):#rest is a list which contains all the leftwover args 
    return [x, args]

def f(x, **kwargs): 
    return "whatver dict has been specified"
#even when kwargs is not specify, use the name (x=1, y=2) in the call where those are the parameters called. CAN USE BOTH KWARGS AND ARGS in one function 
```


## Namespaces
Is a dictionary where keys are Python identifiers. Values are functions, methods, etc. Our program is literally running on a dictionary. 

There is a namespace associated with each class. It has a member which contains its name as a dictionary.  try `c.__dict__`

Names starting with `__` are spacial. 

### Modules & Import
give you control over your namespace. A primitive example is a sourcefile, which assigns values (objects) to name (indexes of our "main" dictionary).

Import creates a new namespace, reads & executes foo.py code in it, assign that namespace to foo. So foo is itself an index in the dictionary. You can use that new namespace after. such that import file. print(file.pi) will get the elements from that new namespace@

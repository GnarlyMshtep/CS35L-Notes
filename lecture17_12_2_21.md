Today: debugging in GDB, sike, this lecture is all over the pagge

# GDB

## Getting started
don't need src code, but you won't have debugging symbols so you can't do much (you are debugging at the machine level -- a pain)
*missed this part, watch the first 3 min of lecture*

Barriers to entry: 
- src code? Not really (but a pain)
- auxilary build tool (just to compile the program so it could be ran in the first place). 
    - for example, for Emacs, we do some pre-build steps 
        - `./autogen.sh`: configures git 
        - makes sure that you have the appropriate build tools. 

The tools that emacs requires to build: 
- automake: you specify makefile templates, Makefile.am (which is the file that the dev writes by hand). We need to prepere to use make. Automake generates Makefile.in 
- autoconf: Makefile.in is ran by autoconf to make Makefile (which is platform dependent)
- configure automatically generated super long shell script. 

What's the audiences for these tools? 
- the devs: assumed to have git, automake, etc, all debugging tools) -- superset of everyone's tools. Generate portable files. 
- builders: Simpler set, the shell, gcc, make, ... Generate executables that are platform dependence. 
- packagers: take the output of the builders and will generate packets ready for installation. Generate something like emacs-29.3.deb, which you can install on ubantu. 
- insatllers: ussuly ops people. 
- testers: std is to run `make check -j5` -j5 to keep cpu and not wait for IO. A lot of time packages test themself

Not uncommon for large projects to have the src for the file that the use to build their project, and to generate more software to help them build. 

### Emacs build phases
- `./autogen.sh` (checks build tools, runs automake, etc) (DONE BY A DEVELOPER)
- `./configure`  (cehcks platform, allows you all sorts of configuration) (BUILDER ussuly deals with). Generates makefile and a config.h 
- `make -j` build emacs executable
- `make install`. Don't have root? use --prefix=$HOME/prefix (or any other spot that is yours and is not the general home )

### Aside: portabillity checking
For example, our application must run on many browsers and many servers. You can put your foot down and say (I only do this!) but people prefer portability (PPP). 

How do I check that my application is compatible with different {versions of node, browser, etc}. This obvious solution is inefficient since overall is: numBrowser*numNodeVersions. That's a lot for a 2 component application! (where there ussuly are many). Grows about exponentially with number of components. Too many things to test exhustively. 

Even low level apps have portabillity issues (32 vs 64 bit, x86-64 vs AARCH64)

- random sample
- bother for best only 


### Why several levels of makefile? 
In one word: standardisation. There's a POXIX spec for `make` (pretty basic since it's teh intersection of all the makes out there). Doesn't have many necessery features -- not enough for ease of development. 

Solution: a boostraping process, a few level of abstraction that make it more convinient, giving you more features. 

a developer should be able to write src files that are incredibely portable all around. The price of that is the cumbersome build process.  

### Commands
*try to debug something in gdb or watch a tutorial or two to make sure yk the basics*

- (gdb) run a b >/tmp/out 
- (gdb) ^C -- regain control 
- (gdb) bt -- get backtrace 
- (gdb) up (turn gdb's attention one level up in the backtrace)
- (gdb) p [EXPR] -- evaluate the expression and print result (can compute variable value)
    - p exit(100) -- this will just exit -- this a powerdul expression. 
    - executing code in the debugged program
    - how implemented? GDB compiles some machine code, put it in mem inside debug process, and then (change the instruction pointer) tells computer continue executing 
    - legitemately modifies the running program.
- (gdb) 
- (gdb) 
- (gdb) 
- (gdb) 
- (gdb) 
- (gdb) 

What you are doing is exploring a program's execution 

### Aside: Why debug w/o src? 
- screwups -- you lost the src 
- bankruptcy -- lose src, or lose compiler. 
- reverse engineer code by competitor 
- forensics -- try to debug program an attacker is making hard to debug. Prof. Sahai: provable program obfuscation 


## More GDB commands
- (gdb) set cwd /etc  
- (gdb) set env PATH /usr/bin:/bin
- (gdb) set disable-randomization yes/no (libraries and objects get put into different places as a security meassure, making it harder for atteckers) turning it off make it harder to debug. This returns to our point from last lectures of reliable crushing. This also connects to *reproducubality* make the same output at the same time. Make debuggers such that psuedorandom gens give the same answers. This is by deafullt on! *This is an example of how debugging your program changes it's behivor.* (what are some other examples)
- (gdb) attach PID (program hasn't started). We say this when we want to debug a running program (such as a running emacs we would liek to debug). 
    - security implications: When attacker breaks in they can run a process as you and run GDB on it. if you break into one program you break into them all. 
    - ubantu (and others) doesn't let you do that anymore. 
    - need to somehow overwrite system security to fully debug/proc/sys/kernal/... 
    - *security vs debuggability* be cautious! 
    - complete control over program's brain 
- (gdb) detach (running on it's own + whatever changes we made to it)
- (gdb) b read_key_sequence (putts a breakpint at a functionNAme/ lineNumber)... GDB modifies your program by putting a function at that place to stop and give control back to gdb 
- (gdb) c (for continue, emacs continues to run) 
- (gdb) info breaks (all the break you have currently set in your program)
- (gdb) watch [EXPR] keep checking the valur of this experssion, and if it changes, stopp. Break point for data instead of program.
    - as it sounnds, we have a one big issue: efficiency. How can it do it without single stepping and calling the expression every time. 
    - it turns out that for single variables there is hardware suppurt for watching (like) 4 mem location up until change. 
    - EX: watch (0<=i && i<1000) (print i first tho, to make sure that it's in range).

### Simple commnds
Often done automaticaally by emacs or something. good to knpw. ALl preceeded with (gdb)
- stepi (steps over a single machine instrucitons)
- step s (single steps through the src code) -- through machine until it find src line number is changed
- next n (single step through the current function, within a funciton, skip through all of g, let it go and then return as a single line of f, the step would step you in g) helps you *operate within an appropriate level of abstraction when debugging*
- fin (finish execution of f) 
- rc (reverse continue), let's let the program run backwards until we reach the most recent break points. Avalabile on some platforms and on request.  
    - not done by running backwards in hw, but it's done in software. 
    - It does it by recording the execution history adn stepping back on the execution history (like in this step we changed x to 5, etc.. must maintain the history )
    - slows things done when you request
- checkpoint (saves entire state and gives you id)
    - cheaper version of rc that you can use to return wherever you'd liek 
- restart ID (fo back to ID printed by checkpint )

*we've gone off the deep end! remember, the best debugging strategy is to not use a debugger!* -- shouldn't be ur first debugging choice.

debugging by print statements should be your first option. 

debugging is aprocess where you have acollection of tools, choose the most efficient on e

### Aside: GDB outside cntrol 
- API for controlling GDB 
- GDB has it's own macro language that you can use to write little GDB programs you can use to execute a bunch of commands you often do. 
- Write GDB commands in Python!

Very programabble! 

many years of debugging, many common things you will want to do debugging 

# Summery of the class: 
What we didn't cover: 
- Machine Learning 
- Big Data 
- Privacy and security (and the tradeoff between them)
- ... 

We did: 
- dump you in a software systems/ language that you can understand it. Gave you the confidence to explore. 
- 

What;s the difference between software construction and software engineering (more about builders/ architects -- actually not that simple). Software is much more complex than a building (supposudly). Frontier of complexity, no one knows how things are gonna work in the future. 

We get more software engineering concepts that are meta-construciton (not as hard science -- boooooooo). 


No mention of CS THEORY!!! CS THEORY! THE MOST EXCITING PART! EVERYONE'S NOOBS! AHASBDHGASVBH!V!GHV!!

Today: Debugging


# Debugging 
Can be seen as the prcess of finding the right $\delta{}$ of where you want to go from where you are (what can't be seen that way?)


is an extrememly inefficient process that you should avoid at all costs. If you can come up with a practice the minimzes debugging over almost anything else. If it's not possible to wholy eliminate, try to make bugs easier to find and fix and fix overall. 

Try targeting whole class of bugs (such as type errors, overflows, etc).
## Methods for preventing bugs (In C/C++)
We focus on the buggiest platforms becouse knowing how to debug them implies we'll be able to debug most other things. 


Note that these warnings have no certainties, they are high and increasing, but not certain. Where these errors are helpful will be due to what you are developing and what for. It is common to include the warnings that are needed in the project standard (included with what comment style, what indents, etc). 
Methods: 

### Static Checking 
#### Nonintrusive (compiler options)
Before the program runs, eliminate a certain class of bugs from execution.

- `gcc -Wall foo.c` turns on a lot of static checks, amongst many other things
- `gcc -Wstrict-aliasing foo.c` warns of using ptrs for the wrong type. The issues that can arise are machine independent depending on types. 
- `gcc -Wmaybe-uninitialized foo.c` warns when the compiler "cannot prove to it's on satisfaction that you set a variable before using it.` Not needed in other languges (like Python and Java where everyhting is initialized of the get-go, BUT, it's still useful because even though compiles -- it will probably output wrong. 
- `gcc -Wtype-limits foo.c` -- not on by `Wall`. when u say something like (u<0) where u is an unsigned produces an error.
- `gcc -fanalyzer foo.c` expends functio from function call inside the first function to see if it can find errors that way. Makes gcc wayyyyy slower. 
```c++
int f(void){
    int v;
    g(&v); //gcc assumes g initalizes v, but it only uses heauristic and doesn't full check. With fanalyzer it will check that g actually intializes
    return v; 
}

```



#### Intrusive (giving compiler advice)
Annotating your program to indicate how it's meant to run and help the compiler catch errors. '

- function decoretors
```c++
_Noreturn void abort(void){
    //can help the compiler generate more effective program (don't push return adress on the stack. Also complain on unreachable code on stuff. I mean, of course it's able to help more with extra info
}
```
- GCC function attributes (less standardized)
```c++
int hash(char const*) __attribute__((pure)) //looks at string contents derefrence form mem. 
```
This attr tells gcc that the return value depends only on the current state of the machine and that thsi function will not change the state of the machine. It's a pure function. It has no unobservable affects outside of it. 
- `int square (int) __attribute__((const))` doesn't depends on other storage, just on input.
- `int errprintf(char const * fint, ...);` Literally `...`, not being negligent. Add `__attribute__((format (printf,1,2)))` First is dec 2 all the other args. You are saying your function is declared on printf. [This is a somewhat better explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2735587/in-a-c-function-declaration-what-does-as-the-last-parameter-do)

### Dynamic Checking 

Check one execution. *Does not check all possible input cases.* Cannot entirely eliminate a class of bugs like static checking can. 

Ops tools, not dev tools. Almost automatic! 

Examples: 
- `ps` command: 
- `top` run ps every x sec (5 by defualt here) run your program and look at ps and top to see what ... you are using (mem ,time, ...). 
- `time` Takes any program as an argument, tells you how much time the program took. Simple but helpful. 
- `strace` runs your program in a special envieroment where you log all sys calls. 
- `ltrace` traces calls to libraries (like Math.cos or stdio.printf). 
- `valgrind` like a debugger that you don't need to run into and runs and gives you errors automatically. I foudn very useful!

*You often don't need to drop into the debugger, look at the logs!* 

#### Runtime checking enforced by the compiler

- `gcc -fantasize=address` Make sure that your buggy program *crashes mroe reliably* bad ptrs make ur program flaky -- sometime fails and sometime does not. We want to fail, and fail loudly! 
    - More precise then valgrind since valgrind runs on already compiled executable, but gcc has access to src!  
    - more code generation for this. (then recompile for full speed, which sometimes is a big deal).
    - valgrind was there first 
- `gcc -fsanatize=undefined` catch undefined behivor by the c standard. CLassic is signed integer overflow. 
(for loop that starts with intmax and goes ++)
- `gcc -fsanitize=leak` mem leaks, as it soudns. 
- `gcc -fsanitize=thread` Threads step on each other. Tries to catch race condition bugs (a shared variable between threads is watched closely). One of the toughest bugs to reproduce and find. Make buggy condition crash right away 

*The goal of all of these things is to **crash realiably***. 


### Avoiding Debugging (Techniques to improve code without relation to compiler/outside tool) (also dynamic)
- If your'e technology (language) crashes your program often (C++ is crashing) pick a good (safer) technology. Chnage to python! (or something)
- *Defensive Programming*: write code that assume that the other modules don't work. That is, call a function and expect a result -- check that you got that result (even when it's in the specs). 
    - traces and logs (figure out what ur program did).
    - checkpoint restart (at a certain point, your program saves its entire state to permenent memory) Then your program can be recovered 
    - assertions `assert({cond})` by `#include assert.h`. -- runtime check that condition, else crash. 
        - There's a `gcc -DNDEBUG` to compile without assert and ignore the mem Ls. 
    - exception handling 
    - barricades: you have internals and externals (internal is ussuly the most of it, externals is ussuly like the input from a user or something). THe coed between the external and the internal is a baricade 
        - tainting: a variable/obj that isn't trusted. Somethign about ti messed up formatting-wise. Yu have runtime check to make sure you don't pass tainted obj into the internals
    - interpeters: execute forgein programs that need to be executed inside a jailors.
        - webrowsers use this approach to run JS. 
        - can be and is done in larger applications
    - virtual machines: an interperted for machine code that is very efficient. Often the same arch as you are running. Jailors at the hardware level. 



# The GDB debugger
Your program runs in its own process (like usual), but another process runnign GDB is actually "in charge" (the OS notifies it if something interesting/stoppage/unusual happens). Addiitonally, GDB can modify the state of your program. Can change machine code of program, etc. *lots of power for GDB!* 

There are attacks that use GDB (mac OS turned some of the syscalls GDB uses for that reason).

Don't need to change program at! you don't even need to be the one who compiled the progream! 

**need to know more about GDB since I didn't use it on the assignment**

To use GDB esaaly it's best to *compile with debugging symbols* `gcc -g foo.c` doesn't change the executable, but bloats foo.o with debugging info (such as: the names (u gave to) local variables).

optimizations of -02 whatever make your code less compilable because the optimizations don't entirely follow your code, but is unpredictable for us. It will look like the program counter is moving around errtically in the src code. The bug may only occur when u optimize so u might have to do it. 

Beginner suggestions: use `-o0`, then debugging will be easier. 


### Aside: Programmer terminology: error fault failure
- error: mistake in the programmer's head
- fault: a possible way that something can go bad, but it hasn't happened yet.
- failure: an observable mismatch between the behivor of the program and desire of users/spec

Imply from bottom to top. We want to minimize failures and do it by reduceing faults and errors ahead of time

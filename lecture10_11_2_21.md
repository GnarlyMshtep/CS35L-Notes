## Git Branches
because development is not linear. Can be arbiturly complicated but ussuly isn't, not so bushy.

### What motivates people to branch? 
1. maintain old releases
2. Conservative AND radical options for users and developers to work with
3. Different visons for what the software should do
4. Portabillity 
5. new features (collide at first, or maybe not everyone would want)
6. parallal work 
7. refactoring (not changing any of the features, but reorginizing the code)
8. Competition (not know what working on). 


Mainline branch, all the new changes from the devs/ Not well testeed just yet. Users shouldn't use. Will eventually turn into the next release\

    -\*-\*-\*-\*-\*-\*-\*-\*-\*-\*-\*-\*-\*-\* (mainline)
        -\*-\*-\*- (release 20 -- slow and conservative)
                -*-*-*-* (release 21, eventually and cautious)

- motivation is to maintain all releases (oh man I did not pay attention he might have said more things)
- satisfy developers who want to be conservative and radical 
- also satisfy users at different levels of radicality (use mainline vs an old reease) 
*another motivation: competing ideas for how software should run*
*another motivation: compatebility with different systems* 

### Git in action (commands and stuff plz read through)
- git branch (list all local branhes)
- git branch -r (list all remote branches)
- git branch --track emacs-27 origin/emacs-27 (I want to get a copy of the emacs 27 branch locally, if someone makes a change, I want to see it locally (emacs 27 is the name of our local))
- ls -lt $(find x -type f) (sorry, wasn;t paying attention)
- git checkout [branchname] OR [commitid](change the local files to match a local or remote reposiroty)
- git checkout HEAD (last commit on current branch)
- branch a lightweight moveable (because you can commit to it, inw hich case it would change) pointer to a commit, allows you to keep track of the commits you care for most. *The branch is identifyign in a nice way where you would like to be in the tree* -- ussuly in a leaf in a tree, a line of development
    - lightweight in the form that all all the commits are in the tree, the branch is just a pointer to a spot in th etree, 
- when you are on a branch, git remmebers your branch and updates it correctly 
- The *detached HEAD* state means that your branch has no name, which you likely don't want to. And if you do commit while detached, you will grow the tree, it commits to where you are (as in pointer from it, and you could only get back to that commit using the id). Won't override other commits. 
- *create a new branch* git branch myNewBranch (lightwieight movable pointers)
- git checkout -b my_new_branch (create new branch and point to it)
- git branch -d myNewBranch (delete the branch -- gets rid of the lightweight pointer, the commit still exists and is accesable by id).
- branches only help 

### Philosophical devide between history look
*Look good vs be accurate* -- those are competing goals. git lets you do either. His advice, don't be extreme, either way. 
*fidelity of history vs buetifull history*


### COmmdans he thinks are useful 
- git branch -m oldname newname (rename a branch-- good for typos)
- git clone local local2 (get 2 compies of the repositories locally, where one mirror what's upstream (remote))
    - work in local2, and once your'e happy (do work, git add and commit)
    - publish the work using -got format-patch main (what does this do? outputs a patch (text) file that contains all git knows to know what is in this commit and reconstruct it)
- git fomat-patch main mybranch (all the changes from  main to  mybranch)
    - what can you do with those patch files? You can email them to your mates, ask them if it looks g) 
    - Now, after the approval of your mates, cd ../local; git pull 

#### Git Pull 
- git fetch (make my local copy of the upstrem repository, match, what's upstrem -- make your origin/ branches be what's upstrem)
- git merge  (merges remote changes into local copy -- he doesn;t like -- what if your local changes disagree? Makes mistakes too often (according to eggert))


### Cont


At this level you are maintaining a branch not a collection of source code fules. What's a branhc?  a set of patches tou want to make. maintaing the set of chenges, rather then the code. operating at a higher level of.

have to write patches to prove that youre code is good, a lot of what you do in real soft development is patches and reading code. 

I need to read more, I don't actually realy get it


## NEXT TOPIC: we are missing on SHARING ALL THIS WORK (git merge)
The big gurilla of git. Without merging, we would just have a ton of branhces and get lost. Users just want to see one stable current best version. Combine all the best features into a single commit of several branches.  

When starting out, don't try merging 3 different commits to one. (octupus merge -- 8 or more commits to) start with 2 way merges. Some projects insist on this. 
does this in the following steps
1. find the closest common ancestor
2. apply both changes of merges (if one changes fileX the other fileY--easy! What do you do if they affect the same file? IF the affect different parts of the file -- still work) (the following heuristic work only a certain part of the time. One might chnage the defniiton of a function and another --- *just a hueritic, not always right, sometime misses collisons* 
    Problem: two different delats that affect the same lines of development.
    How do we resolve?
        - git will tell you "watch out for files f and g" -- there was a colision there it couldn't handle
        - when it does that, it makrks the text in the file with <<< (A), --- Anc ==== B (when you do it, don't guess, really do it, by hand and think real hard). Keep the diffs in mind and even look at them in the same time. 

*diffrence in pushing* -- you add your files upstream. 

- suggestion: check your merges for messups\
    - git diff A (first branch we merged) M (merged branched)
    - git diff B M 
    to know if these are right, before the merge, git diff A, git diff B. 
- git is dumb, knows about text lines, not what you are doing. 

### Alternative to merging (merging vs rebasing)
Rebasing -- want to merge but without the hustle. 

    -*-*-*-*-*-*-\ --- - -- - (main)
                  \-*-*-*--* my branch (HEAD points to last commit here)

Started new branch but people kept working upstream. COuld merge myBranch and main.
- git rebase main  
- appplies all the delats from our branch to the leaf of the main branch. Works only for sufficinetly small branches

Today : Compiling, Debugging, etc
What is low level and compilation good for? 
focus on C and CPP (fancier compilation option for old low level languages)

# Compiler options
Switching between one flag and another is a new envieroment. Change in envieroment may expose (or mask) bugs in your code. 

## Security/Correctness Improvement
Low level langs have a high security bugs on how to break into C/C++ programs
*stack overflow attack is an example* **understand it**

### `-f-stack-protect`
: somwhat less efficient, but does checks
    What GCC will do is make our arrays larger at the begining of the begining of the stack. Puts canary at the begining of the stack.
    int canary = R (some random value)
    just before we return make sure that the canary is equal to R. Now attacker needs to make sure it finds the canary with R. 
    if index over the canary.

    Turn off with `-fno-stack-protector`
    (controversial)

### Static checks
static because the program is not running yet -- at compile time compiler is looking. Compiler must think of all (or many) executions of your program. Static checking makes your program more reliable

+ zero runtime cost
+ some error cannot happen in runtime (can't like, refrence a null pointer)
- less precise than runtime checks

#### Intrusive static checking 
tell the compiler -- check this while compiling 

std way: __static_assert(C) where C is any condition but something you can eval at compile time. 

Example: 
```c++
__static_assert(EOF==-1); //make sure that EOF is what we assume. Also documents the assumption we made, better, faster, than something if the
// else check. Spelled this way in C2x (next version of c std). in current v: 
_static_assert(C,"ouch");
static_assert(C) //in C++
/*some code assume EOF == -1, true on linux, maybe not elsewhere*/
```

#### Non intrusive static checkking 
`gcc -Wall` -W is common, -Wall says turn on ALL the warnings. So useful that it's not practical to use every one of them.
*since now there are so many, all just means the one that are likely to be useful (where teh decision is arbit).

Example is `-Wcomment`, a comment not prop closed such as `/* x2 /* Y */` technically valid, perhaps wrong
           `-W parntheses for `a\<\<b+c` take a into b first or add first? a & b| c(or actually has priority)
           -Waddress (comparing adress with pointer such as str == "doc") where that compares their pointer calues where doc doesn;t have one (or
           must be wrong since we just saw dic, these can't be the sam 

Warning does mean that your program is worng! Just perhaps think about changing it our turning notifications with `-Wno-parentheses`

`Wstrict-aliasing`: 
```c++
long l = 27;
int *p = (int *)&l; //pretend 64 bit qunatity is 32
return *p
//return value depends on endiness of machine 
//controversial for kernal
```



## Preformence Improvement
Q: Optimize for what? You can optimize for different things. `-o` is bland optimization that is sueful for all and nonoffensive. 
Why not optimize by defualt if it is so nonconversial? gcc runtime costs.  

### `gcc -o` (optimize & varients) NON-INTRUSIVE
A slow build can be a large problem with a larger optimizations. During dev, we might not care about optimization as much as gcc runtim 

*Varients on optimization for time (levels)*: 
1. `gcc -o2` -- Eggert's sweet spot
2. `gcc -oN` for N goes on

*Varients on optimzation for space*: 
1. `gcc -os` optimize for space

*Other varients*:
1. `gcc -og` optimize for debuggability (with some speed involved as well -- many optimizations make really confusing machine code
    for example, GCC may choose to not put a backtrace on where the current stack frame came from)
2. `gcc o0` no optimizations (perhaps less optimizations than regular)
3. `gccc -fltc` link-time optimization
        What does it do? Instead of compiling all .o to optimized machine code, but instead high level description. There is a link time optimization path before the linker that looks at all your program at once, and then optimizes with respect to your entire codebase. 
        `lto` the link time optimizer, takes a long time.   

### INTUSIVE preformence improvemtn
intrusive = gotta change your src code. 

Tell your compiler how your program runs 
#### \__atribute__ for function optimization:
 giving pragramtic preformence advice to compiler.  (non portable) to make protable put somewhere at beging of program
```c
    # if ! __GNUC__
        # define __atribute__(x)
    #endif
If not GCC, make attribute a macro that expends to nothing, that doesn't affect compilation of that code
```
put in code: 
```c++
void abort(void) __atribute__(({cold,hot})) //-- unlikely/likely will call abort
//can put code for calls far away to not waste valueable cache space (as if I know what tha is)
//L1 and L2 cache to contain whatever it muct

__attribute__((noreturn)) //abort never returns as in, like not a value, but to return out of it. (can just jump to it, but don't need 
//to put it's return value on the stack)
//so popular it was standardized 
_Noreturn void abort(void)//... 

```

#### \__atribute__ for data optimization optimization:
COMING BACK TO TAGGED THING. 

a common thing to do is ask what object type are we pointing to. A slow thing to do is to derefrence the pointer, and go to the object 
where the first word is type. Now, every time we just need type we get the entire object which is wastefull.

Alternatively, we can use the last 3 bits of the pointer from pointer to tell us what the type. The last type is "other." (doesn;t pullote the
cache). The example did that 
```c++
(long) p* = //something 
//we tag by adding 3, and when we need to derefrence we untag. 
// works if we can assume that teh last 3 bits are 0, for which we need to allign (since mem adresses don't go to 64)
//then we 
(char*)((long) p & ~7) to undo the last 3 bits
//!okay this is actually kinda beatifull!
```


```c++
#define SIZE __attriute__((aligned(8)))
char arr[SIZE]
//compute stuff into arr if(strcmp(arr,"ABC")==0)
// make sure that things are on a multiple 8 -- faster comparison 
char *p = &a[0];
long l = (long) p;
long tagged_l = l+3; //(to create a type of 61 bit val and 3 bit tag)
```
### Program Profiling 
`gcc -coverage foo.c` count the number of times each statement gets executed. (not as bad as you think because can only 
count the function entrences and exists and conditional branchings.)

Outputs those flags on a bunch of binary files. use `gcov` to analyze that. Look for hotspots in your program (statements taht got executed a
whole lotta time. Use other knowledge to optimize the code as fast as you can). Allows you to focus on the essence. (eliminate and tune 
the hottest spots). Proceed and profile again. 

### __builtin_unreachable()
Your program, at run-time, must never call a function tagged `__builtin_unreachable()`. What's it for then? Any call to this function 
is a message from the program to the compiler that thsi line cannot be reached. Giving the compiler advice that this part of the program must not run. 

```c++
#define assume(x) ((x) ? (void)0 : __builtin_unreachable())
//lets us tag an x s.t compiler can assume that it is true. 
int g(int n){assume(n>=0); return n +n/2;} // code generated is now faster

//could make a function 
static void assume(int x){ if(!x) :__builtin_unreachable}
//macro is better, works for all types. (void)0 is a something that doesn't return, so you don;t asy if(assume(x)). 
//not generating any machine instructions, just telling the compiler that it can assume this. It wouldn't make any __bui;tin_unreahable calls.



```


## Unexpected results of optimization
```c++
int n = INT_MAX;
int p = n+1;
if (p < n ){
    return -1;
}
```

The compiler will assume p>n and optimize and our check for integer overflow will fail. This si technically our fault since behivor on integer overflow is undefined.

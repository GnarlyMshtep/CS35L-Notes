Today: Version Control (detour), C (Low level software dev)

Again, level of abstraction, need to know above and below at the very least

## C (today)
- rarely used for end user applications, C++ is more common for end users, but it's usage is still declining (for that purpose).
- currently they are used to write components/ auxilary tools for software developments. 
- We will talk about the pitfalls of this low level approach. (not as bad as he will tell)

### What sort of components are talking about?
One example is Python, another is the Linux Kernel (Big C program that run under all ), Emacs,....


### C++ vs C
Diffrences (things in C++ not in C -- C replacement often detailed): 
- C++ has classes, OOP. That's not built into C. Rather C has storage, variables, data structures (`struct`)

    - encapsulation
    - inheritence
    - polymorphism (C has some, but only built-in-- knowing to add doubles and ints with the same `+`)
- namespaces (in C, the closest thing is seperate files)
- Overloading (C has `_generic`)
- exception handling (try, catch). In C, `#include<setjmp.h>`, but really bad. The idea is that if you need try catch -- you are doing it the wrong way. If you *really* have too -- return a special value. (debate about overuse)
- memory allocation (heap allocation) -- the `new` operator (write your own heap). In C you use malloc(bytes), realoc, free, 
- I/O `cin`/`cout`. C has `<stdio.h>` which has more rudimentry stuff. 
- templates in C++ (the replacement in C is some nuts thing)



C is the lowest level software tools that runs everywhere. C++ was originally a C compiler. C++ implements all those features using low level tricks on C. Can have pointer to functions, apperantly, I didn't know that. The syntax is horrible, but you can do it and clean it up with typdef. (less of a need in C++ because can use all those extra machinery).


### Architecture of C/C++ Envieroment
The phases which C/C++ compilers go through to generate C programs

Levels: (bottom to top)
- machine (we don't talk about much)
- your program's machine instruction (with your architecture's commads) | OS kernal (adds syscalls that your program can call t do low level OS stuff), implemented in C as well)

How did your program get there? OS loader loads a.out (contains machine isntructions of your program in a file, and some meta data at the begining). 

Where did a.out come from? `foo.o`, `bar.o`, `libc.a` --exec for C lib,     `libregex.c`. There was a program (`ld` -- linker), that produces an a.out files 

How did you built a `*.o` file? `bar.s` -- another level of machine level? 

where did your `bar.s` come from? `bar.i`, which is a preprocessoer file, and `gcc` turns `bar.i` into `bar.s`



#### Aside about `Static`
create a foo.c file with a static function `f`. No other file can call `f`, another file can have it's own `f`. C does that in the compilation.  


#### Aside about Exception Handling 
The idea is to make the code readable on the usual case, where exception happens only rarely. Complaints: also helps the bad guys figure out. Also, the problems are ussuly in the `except` block, which turns out to be more realiable.  

```c++
try{
    x = f(y)
    return g(x)
}catch(...){
    //do error thing
}
```
altarnative: 
```c++
x=f(y)
if(x==EOF){
    return -3
}
....

```

#### Aside: `Generic` in C 
behaves differently depending on the type 

```
return _Generic(E,
                float: 1,
                long: 2,
                defualt: 1)
``` 
may see this in a macro (abs example)

#### Aside: C, programmign std (atomic access)
Run on the bare minimum, no OS is needed. C offers atomic acsess, usefull for threading. 

POSIX, is the OS std that ca

### C Compilers
top, currently: GCC & Clang (intel -- icc, invedia --nvcc (hardware specialized))

Issue: Compiler protability -- the hardest portability problem, since talking to the lowest level.

3 types of protabillity: 
- target - what machine will gcc generate for? (can generate for whatever you choose -m32 (for predecessor of x86-64) -mx32 (for x86-64, but in 32-bit mode -- some newwer faster instructions then -m32)). (where will the compiled software run?)
- build - what modu(???) are you compiling on (what version of gcc are you compiling with? or using what version?) (on what machine are you builfing your compiler)
- host- when will the compiler that you build run on 


### GCC's assumptions
What assumptions do you make about the machines you are compiling for? 

- flat adress space (memory is just a sequence of bit, each adressed) (not all machines behave this way, EX: tag architecture)
- word size can be 64, 32, 16,..
- are the code and data in the same adress space? (Data to code adressed the same but go to different adress spaces -- can access more memory (because of int size)) -- how does this work? Data and function pointers point to different places. 

### How GCC deals with different architechtures? 
We have ARM, x86, etc... WHat can we do? 
- right \$n\$ different x86 -- inefficient and terrible to maintain 
- share as much code as possible. How? using it's own programming language called the *machine description language*. (stored in `.md` files -- not markdown -- language they devised to describe machines). Lists what instructions, what they do, how they can be used -- a manual that the compiler can and does use. 

When we build, .md is compiled to your target 

ABI is one of the things in this file, details "How do you do a function call in this system?? Microsoft and Linux don;t agree on ABI (calls with more than 6 args, remmeber?) -- so .md are also OS dependent, nto only architecture. 


#### Aside: You want your compiled code to run faster (GCC can help!)
JIT interface for GCC (libgcijit) -- *gcc as a subroutine*
```
char * string (source code)
void (*mc)(void)(machien code)

mc()
```
(literally compiling strings to code, in runtime, and running it)

### GCC: working with different languages
.c,.cpp,.java,... gcc can compile different languages (different language frontends)

1. Parsers generate rees isns a standard GENERIC data structure
2. GCC-specific phashe (GIMPLE-form), 3 address representation EX: MULT(b,c,t_1), higher level instructions that you can compile into more specific instructions (GIMPLIFICATION)
3. Translate GIMPLE into SSA (single static assignment) -- only assign to local variable. have body of loops get created and get pulled out of context. loop unrolling (if possible, doesn't have to implement i each time). *yah idk what this stage does*

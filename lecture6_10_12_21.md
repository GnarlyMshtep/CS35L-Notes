Today: Configuration in relation to envieroment (from last time), Scripting 



## Heavyweight & Lightweight scripting (spectrum, on a philosophical level + historical trends)
`sh` is lightweight langugae -- small and not do very much -- sets up for the big boys to do the actual work) (few but strong -- heavy commands) 

`python` is a heavyweight scripting language (lots of operations -- which are small)

to some extent, converging. See command 1 and 2 -- more heavyweight.
In python, for example, we now have pytorch script ML, all computation in C u just set up. 

Scripting languages are ussuly very forgiving with typographical error -- give you some sensical response, and says "eh... let's keep going"

## `sh` For Configuration
Take for example the following command

```bash
sort <foo.txt | sed 's/a/b/' | grep boot
```

*a very brief summery of a very complicated configuration*

We configured 3 programs and how they should run. We canve them stdin, args, and stdout. Think about doing it with your programs, like python programs and such. 

`grep`, and all commands we don't configure, have *defualts.* For example, `grep` by defualt outputs stderr and stout to the terminal. 

Another configuration is the current *working directory*. Supposadly, configuration is as if not more important the the software itself. It is disrespected and underdone. *Configuration wizards* try to guess what you will want and configure. *Configuration GUIs* vs *Configuration CLIs* -- for the latter, ther configuration must be expressible as text. The GUIs have the visual advantage, but, its a pain to maintain a picture which can mess up/limit configs.


## Executing a `sh` command
`grep abc def ghi` does: 
1. finds the executable grep file in usr/bin by consulting the $PATH variable.
2. Puts the arguments on the main mem as a regular array for `grep.exe`
3. return 



### Aside: Exit Status
- `0`: Success
- up to 127!

grep only: 
   
    1- not found
    2- trouble-fail


## Quoting (more problamatic than you would think!)
<center>In `sh`</center>
needed some way to have a space in a string (other than \SPC)

- Single quotes -- explicit, what you se is what you get 
- Double quotes -- Can place somethign in there that *gets evaluated* (suggested: use these only for a reason, use the simpler tool, not only for ptrformence, but for orginization -- think about your thinking time, preformence is negligable) Example:
    
    ```bash
         "the exit status was $?" -- evaluetes $? and places value as string. Instead we can put there "What did you find: $(grep matan.txt helloWorld)"
    ```

Can nest as deep as you would like.


### List of `sh` special charecters

1. "
2. '
3. \
4. `
5. |
6. \* -- *filename expension* -- globbing, not regExp. `*` is the `a*.c`
7. ? -- *filename expension* -- just like `*` but `?` matches one charecter only
8. [ -- *filename expension* -- a[b-z].c anything in the range -- matches 1
9. & Running in the background, example `emacs &` -- to terminate `fg` (foreground) and then `C-c`.
10. `=` assigments of strings `abc=def` `echo $abc` outputs `def`. 
11. SPACE 
12. NEWLINE
13. TAB 
14. < stdin 
15. \> -- std out
16. ; seperate args
17. ! -- not POSIX stdardised -- *negates the command* -- negates the exit status.
18. ~

### Nonspecial `sh` charecters
```+,-,@,%,^,_,/, \, ,., {,},] ```

## Tokens (for the `sh`) 
*(builtins)* |,&,|| (logical OR),&& (logical AND),() (run in subshell),<>, <<>> -- `<<EOF` -- std in until you type EOF, ;; , ;

*(words)* nonspecial chars or strings jammed together with no whitespace. Makes for a single argument. Can concatanate string just by not putting a space between them.

**(reserved words)** Are not for exceuting a word from usr/bin. Instead they: 

- if
- while
- that sorta thing that works with the *shell's control structue*

```bash
! grep lebron /etc/passwd && echo 'Lebron is missing'
```
*will echo lebron is missing if lebron is not found -- think about it*

execute command `{COMANDS}` as a block, i.e. inexsesible from outside, etc. `()` does subshell while `{}` executes as the parent shell. Think of to see the diffrence: 
```bash
(cd /etc; grep eggert passwd) VS {cd /etc; grep eggert passwd}
```
*the second option actually changes the envieroment --2nd a bit mroe efficient* 

To *run in parallal*:
```bash
(A & B) or with curly 
```

### if then else
```bash
if COMMANDS
then COMMANDS
elif COMMANDS
then COMMANDS
else COMMANDS
fi
```

### pattern matching 
```bash
    case WORD in 
    (pattern) COMMANDS
    (pattern_2) COMMANDS
    (*) COMMANDS
    esac
```
-- can nest if you would like to AND multiple cases.


### for in 
```bash
for $i in WORD 
do COMMANDS 

done

```

### Variable substuiton

- `${abc-def}` -- interpolate `abc` unless it does not exist then use `def`. 
- `${abc:-def}` -- treat the empty string as it was not assigned to. 
- `${abc?} exit because there is no resonable defult 
- `${abc?:}` -- add empty as unset
- `${abc=def}` -- if abc's value is empty assign abc to it and then interpolate def
- `${abc%.c}` printout abc but strip off a `.c` in the end if it has one.  

### Special Vars

1. $? most recent exit status
2. \$\$ current shell's process id

```
ps -ef | grep \$\$
matan    3548703 3548697  0 14:06 pts/18   00:00:00 -bash
matan    3556074 3548703  0 15:37 pts/18   00:00:00 ps -ef
matan    3556075 3548703  0 15:37 pts/18   00:00:00 grep --color=auto 3548703
```

3. `$!` last background process id.

*help you control all the stuff that you configured* 


*distinvtion between unset and default value*

## Random Stuff (mostly commands)
1. `expr 3 +4` super slow old syntax -- executes another program 
2. `expr $((3 + 4)) -- all in the shell no overhead
3. `$?` exit status of the most recent command that you ran. (2 is err)
4. `kill PROCESS_ID`, polite, add a -9 to end the process. 
5. `wait PROCESS_ID` for a process to finish, don't do anything else in the meanwhile.
6. Note **field spilitting** example: 
```bash
x=$(pwd)
cd /etc
...doStuff...
cd $x
```
*Working directory may be made up of multiple words and that will mess us up*

7. use `--` to say whatever comes after this is a filename. **never assume that whatever is running your server is your client**  

## Questions

1. Try to turn 6,7,8 into regExp. Test yourself! 
2. what do 17, and 18 do ?
3. What do all the variable substution do.

## My opinion on this lesson
This stuff should be learned through practice and stored in a neat manual -- not studied.

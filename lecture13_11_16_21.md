Today: Backups (Ops people worry about), Version control (Devs worry about)

# History of Git 

### What is a version control? 

## The different needs of backups and version control

**Version control needs**: 
- recoever from screwup -- fancy undo (undo something from last week, or a whole set of things, etc). 
- explore history: answer the *why* questions. Why is it the way it is? Why not another way? An altarnative tech for comments. 

**Backup needs**: 
- undo massive data changes 
- Motivated by being able to respond to failure scenerios
    
    - you lose power
    - flash drive fails (some or none is recoverable)
    - user deletes/ trashes files by mistake 
    - an outside attacker deletes/trashes files (ransomeware)
    - *the hardest problem* inside attacker doing teh same thing -- because he could trash your backups. *we will not consider this*. 

### Statistics to decide what to respond to: Annularize failure rate (AFR)
Prob that drive fails in a year of uses (use quantification somewhat subjective) 
The precentege is .2%-2.5% per year. 

## What are some possible backup strategies? 
strats: 
- RAID-1 *mirroring*: Have 2 drives having the same data, prob both fail is tiny. not cost affective. (relatively) Esay to implement. Proce scales linearly with storage. The combined AFR$\neq{}(AFR)^2$ because the events are not independent. But it's also a passimastic estimate because you replace bad drives. Operations stadd person will make these calculations routinely.

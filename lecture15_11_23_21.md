Today: Git continued, Debugging. 


# Back to: Git Internals
Atop of POSIX file system. 

Git object reside in /ef/9821e398218u29273

We hope collisions never happen -- and they really don't unless someone tris to cause a collision. 

### ObjType1: Blob 
Just a bytestring -- git doesn't care what's in their. Just ordianry information. 

### ObjType2: Tree 
Branch node of a tree of objects. Roughly corrosponds to a directory, maps names to objects. *Could actually be any graph, not only tree*

Contents: 

Mode, Type, ShaID, name_in_this_tree

Type is cached in the tree for preformence reasons. 

There's a tree for each commit -- a commit is an important tree. 

### ObjType3: Commit
representative of a state of a software development repository. Has parents (typically one). Has a justification -- *answer the WHY questions*. Supposed to give you meta information that isn't in the comments. Motivation for the tree. 

## Git Internals

### Some commands: 
1. `git-hash-object`: hash what's passed. 

    - use --stdin to read it from stdin 
    - use -w to actually write it to the git objects -- can use to create new obj in database. 
    - doesn't care about what's teh filename or anything just the content 
    - smart enough to not store 2 copies of the same data in teh database

2. `git-cat-file`: output an object by it's hash 

    - -t to print type
    - -p to print the contents 
    - git-cat-file hashahsh^{tree} -- prints out the tree at teh top commit **what's the tree? read about git internals**

3. (create a tree) `git update-index --add --cacheinfo "100644 (mode, readwrite to mme, read for anyone else) ,hashashash, filename" 
    git-write-tree`

    - what did we do? 
    - Updates you plan for teh future. 
    - Built a tree, but it's not mega useful since it's not an important tree liek a commit. 

4. git commit-tree hashOfTree (then write commit message until you write C-d) -- commits should have a nice short line, then a blank line, then, more info

## How to explore a Repository/ make a repository explorable?  + TAGS
`git tag` NAME HASHOFCOMMIT (ofc HEAD works). 
now anything where we would put the has we can put the. It's a symbolic link to the hash. Most commonly used for versioning things that won't change and you want people to be able to access at any given time. 

*branches are tags that move as you commit -- think "bleeding-edge" branch*. We don't need branches -- we could just go with tags and move them manually -- but it's less convnience

A tag is stored in the tags folder and is literally a file with the symbolic name which has the commitHash as the only content.

## Merging vs Rebasing + What's rebasing
Merging -- as discussed in discussion where the merge of 2 branches goes to 1 commit becimes the head of both, etc. 

Rebasing -- take the changes you made to an old version and apply to them to the current version. Fake history. *this all comes back to the buetifull vs real history* -- rebasing is too beatifull.  

Working at the later works for both, even though src files are the same. 

git rebase -i (interactively) BRANCH (programming at a different level -- editing our history )

git commit -amends (change the commit u just did to a different commit). 

Rebasing works best when a few changes on ur private copy 

## Remotes (remote repositories / upstream)
You are developing a program with a lot of other people where you guys are all talking to the same remote repositories. 

`git remote` -- what your remote is, the most common name is origin. You usully get a remoe bu cloning the reposity from upsream. `-v` fag talls you where the fetch and the push in particular come from. 

Can have more remotes for sub-working groups. 

`git fetch` updates a branch in the local repository to match the remote. 

### Stashing 
```
git stash 
git checkout main 
work and fix main 
git checkout myBranch
gto stash apply -- bring back the work 
--don't need to commit but can save
```
can git stash list if you have multiple stashes -- else u apply more recent one's


### Git bisect 
you have a linear change of commits and a bug is introduced a lng the way. We have a script that return with status 0 on success. We can binary search through the linear chain to find the commit that broke the sytem. Assumes we have [nonbuggy]|[buggy]which could alternate so it's not always true. 

ex: 
`git bisect start FROM_COMMIT TO_COMMIT
`git bisect run sh -c 'make && ./testScript'` it will take a while possibly because of make, but yep this will wokr. 
sh plz run shell -c plz run it as if it was a shell script

can `git skip COMMIT_ID` if you skip commit that may not give us solution. supposed to do the alternating thing.z


*how to do for more complex history*: 
(it works but the inner algo get more complex) -- prob works but he doesn't know
